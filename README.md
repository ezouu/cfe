# Common Firmware Environment (CFE)

## Summary

The Common Firmware Environment (CFE) is a versatile firmware platform designed to initialize and manage the hardware of embedded systems. It provides essential services such as bootloading, diagnostics, and hardware abstraction, allowing for smooth interaction between software and hardware components.

## ARM /printf

### Overview

The ARM /printf implementation in CFE is designed to provide robust and efficient formatted output capabilities for embedded systems. It is optimized for ARM architectures, ensuring compatibility and performance in various hardware configurations.

### Features

- **Formatted Output:** Supports standard printf formatting options for integers, strings, floats, and more.
- **Hardware Integration:** Leverages ARM-specific instructions and optimizations.
- **Lightweight Implementation:** Designed to minimize resource usage, crucial for embedded systems with limited memory and processing power.

### Usage

The ARM /printf functions are typically used for debugging and logging purposes within the CFE. They can be called from various parts of the firmware to provide real-time feedback and status updates.

## misccmds

### Overview

The `misccmds` module in CFE provides a collection of miscellaneous commands that enhance the functionality and usability of the firmware environment. These commands cover a wide range of utility functions not categorized under other specific command modules.

### Key Commands

- **`version`:** Displays the current version of the firmware.
- **`help`:** Lists all available commands and their descriptions.
- **`reboot`:** Initiates a system reboot.
- **`shutdown`:** Powers down the system safely.

### Implementation

The `misccmds` commands are implemented in the `ui_misccmds.c` file, where each command is defined and its behavior is specified.

## examcmds

### Overview

The `examcmds` module contains a set of examination commands used primarily for testing and debugging the system. These commands allow developers to inspect and manipulate various aspects of the system's state.

### Key Commands

- **`memdump`:** Dumps the contents of a specified memory region.
- **`regdump`:** Displays the values of system registers.
- **`iostat`:** Provides statistics on I/O operations.

### Implementation

The `examcmds` commands are implemented in the `ui_examcmds.c` file. Each command is tailored to provide detailed information that assists in system diagnostics and troubleshooting.

## systicktimer

### Overview

The `systicktimer` module in CFE is responsible for managing the system tick timer, a critical component for timekeeping and scheduling in embedded systems. It provides precise timing and interrupt handling capabilities.

### Features

- **Accurate Timekeeping:** Ensures precise measurement of elapsed time.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Generates periodic interrupts for task scheduling.
- **Low Overhead:** Optimized for minimal performance impact.

### Usage

The `systicktimer` is typically initialized during system startup and used throughout the firmware to manage timed operations and schedule tasks.

## resethandler

### Overview

The `resethandler` module manages the system reset functionality, ensuring a controlled and orderly reset process. It handles various types of resets, including hardware and software-initiated resets.

### Features

- **Controlled Reset:** Ensures all system components are properly reset.
- **Error Handling:** Logs reset causes and errors for post-reset diagnostics.
- **Customizable:** Allows for customization of reset behavior based on specific requirements.

### Implementation

The `resethandler` is implemented in the `cfe_resethandler.c` file. It includes functions for initiating and managing the reset process, as well as logging and handling errors.
