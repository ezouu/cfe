    *  Main CFE include file			File: cfe.h
    *  
    *  This file is the first file included by most CFE modules.  It
    *  brings in definitions for the most commonly used internal
    *  routines and data and also makes sure the right configuration
    *  files get included in the correct order.   If you need to
    *  bring in additional definitions, put them _after_ this file.
